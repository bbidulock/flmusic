    This program calls ALSA functions, not OSS functions.

I use:
    fltk-1.3.x-r10019, alsa-libs-1.0.27, libpthread,
    linux-3.10.x, gcc-4.8.2, a soundcard with CMI-8768 chip.

I additionally use:
    libsox-14.4.1

Without libsox:
    this program can play music CD.

With libsox:
    this program additionally can play all music files libsox can handle.

The directory convert/ contains a simple program. With this program the
file lang.h has been converted to lang.h_utf8.
